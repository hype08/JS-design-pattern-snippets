# VSCode Snippets for JavaScript Design Patterns

## Introduction

Design patterns are reusable object-oriented solutions to commonly occurring software problems.  

The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

This repository was created for me to learn design patterns in JavaScript, as well as to accomplish the goal of turning them into highly reusable code snippets for my text editor.
